        <h1 class="intro">Excuse Me, How Much For This Policy?</h1>
        <p>
            Many people believe that the purpose of democracy is to bring benefit to the majority through election of officials by the majority. However, political parties raise billions of dollars through 'donations' from corporations or their representitives. Are these 'donations' affecting political decision making? Is America a democracy or a corporatocracy?
            <br/><br/>We shall answer this question by contrasting 'donations' to political parties by industry with the major policies passed into law during each party's term in office for the last 3 cycles.
